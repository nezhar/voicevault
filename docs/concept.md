# VoiceVault - Vultr Track

## Project Overview

VoiceVault is building the secure future of enterprise voice intelligence. We combine cutting-edge AI/ML with enterprise-grade security to transform how businesses capture, analyze, and act on their voice conversations. From sales calls to customer support interactions, we're creating agentic workflows that turn every conversation into a competitive advantage while keeping your data safe in the vault.

## Hackathon Requirements

### Core Requirements ✅
- **Groq API Integration**: Ultra-fast inference for real-time call processing and transcription (with file size limits of 25MB for free tier or 100MB for dev tier)
- **Llama Model**: Advanced dialogue understanding and context-aware summarization using Meta's Llama 3.2/3.3
- **Vultr Track**: Enterprise-ready web application deployed on Vultr cloud infrastructure

### Team Information
- **Team Name**: VoiceVault – Vultr Track
- **Track**: Vultr Track - Agentic Workflows for the Future of Work
- **Focus**: Enterprise phone call summarization and workflow automation

## Problem Statement

Enterprise teams handle countless voice conversations daily—sales calls, customer support, team meetings, and client consultations. Manual summarization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and leads to lost insights and missed opportunities. VoiceVault addresses this critical workflow bottleneck.
