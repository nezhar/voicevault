🧠 Agentic Workflows for the Future of Work

Build a Web-Based Enterprise Agent Deployed on Vultr

In this track, you'll design and develop a web-based AI agent purpose-built to support enterprise teams—from marketing to sales, operations, and beyond. Your mission: create a smart, agentic tool that simplifies, accelerates, or transforms workflows for today’s (and tomorrow’s) knowledge workers. The core app should be deployed on Vultr infrastructure and optimized for real-world business use cases.

🔍 What We’re Looking For:
• Enterprise-Ready: Your agent should address pain points or opportunities within marketing, sales, customer success, HR, or other enterprise functions.

• Agentic & Autonomous: Move beyond simple prompts. Build workflows where the agent can reason, plan, and act with minimal human input. Think multi-step tasks, decision trees, and feedback loops.

• Future-of-Work Focused: Help teams save time, make smarter decisions, or enhance collaboration—through the lens of what future employee experience could look like.

• Web-Based & Deployed on Vultr: The app must be a deployable web app running on Vultr. You can use any stack, language, or framework, but it should be cloud-hosted and publicly accessible (Vultr credits will be provided).

• Scalable Tooling: We encourage—but don’t require—use of technologies like vector databases, model context protocol (MCP), or other modular, scalable AI components.

🛠️ Tech Flexibility:
• Use any programming language or framework.
• Use open-source LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation. (Also available via Vultr Serverless Inference)

📦 Developer Expectations:
• Include a GitHub repo with setup instructions, agent capabilities, and a sample use case demo.
• Deploy on Vultr (we’ll provide credits and assistance).
• Show how your app solves a real problem in an enterprise context.
