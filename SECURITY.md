## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in VoiceVault, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue
2. **Do not** publish details publicly
3. **Do** contact the maintainers privately via email

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Rotate API keys and secrets regularly
- Use different credentials for development, staging, and production

### API Keys
- Keep Groq API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
- Use environment variables for all API credentials
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity

### Database Security
- Use strong database passwords
- Restrict database access to necessary IP addresses only
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production
- Regularly backup and test database recovery procedures

### Container Security
- Use official base images from trusted sources
- Regularly update container images for security patches
- Run containers with minimal privileges
- Use Docker secrets for sensitive data in production

### Access Control
- Use the built-in authentication system in production
- Generate strong, unique access tokens
- Implement proper session management
- Log authentication attempts for monitoring

## Security Features

### Authentication
- Bearer token authentication for API access
- Configurable global access token for PoC deployments
- Automatic token validation on protected endpoints
- Secure token storage in browser localStorage

### Data Protection
- Encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) in production
- S3-compatible storage for file uploads
- Secure file upload validation
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### Infrastructure Security
- Container-based deployment with isolation
- Environment-based configuration management
- Reverse proxy setup with nginx
- Health checks and monitoring endpoints

## Deployment Security

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set strong authentication tokens
- [ ] Use secure S3 credentials
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings
- [ ] Enable logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

### Environment Variables
Required for production:
- `ACCESS_TOKEN`: Strong, unique authentication token
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Valid Groq API key
- `POSTGRES_*`: Secure database credentials
- `S3_*`: Secure object storage credentials

### Network Security
- Use private networks for internal communication
- Expose only necessary ports (80, 443)
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Use VPN for administrative access
